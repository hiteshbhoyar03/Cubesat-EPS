This is the dedicated Electrical Power System (EPS) board designed as part of a modular CubeSat architecture. Built around a dual-MCU architecture with power management, overcurrent protection, and solar energy handling, this board ensures regulated and protected power distribution for all CubeSat subsystems.

Designed for reliability, fault tolerance, and modularity, the EPS handles **power generation, regulation, protection, distribution, and monitoring** for the CubeSat stack.

🛠️ Built using dual STM32 microcontrollers with redundant control paths and hardware protections, this board aims to simulate a real-world EPS for low-Earth orbit CubeSats.

> 🚀 This project is for **learning and portfolio building**, and simulates real-world aerospace-grade embedded systems and power electronics design.
